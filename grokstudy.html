            </div>
            <h2>The Theme</h2>
            <p>Awakening to the Sacred in the Ordinary – Embracing a world where God’s presence infuses every part of creation.</p>

            <div class="snippet">
                <h2>The Snippet</h2>
                <p>In Celtic spirituality, the world is seen as a seamless whole where spirit and matter are deeply interconnected, with the divine present in all things—a gentle form of panentheism. Nature itself becomes a “second book” of revelation alongside Scripture, inviting us to notice God’s fingerprints in rivers, trees, and daily tasks. This sacramental worldview transforms ordinary moments—milking a cow, lighting a fire, or walking a familiar path—into quiet encounters with the sacred.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rhythm">
                <h2>The Daily Rhythm</h2>
                <p><strong>Morning Invocation</strong><br>As I rise with the dawn, O Creator of light and leaf, open my eyes to Your nearness in the world around me. Let every breath of wind and every drop of dew whisper of Your presence today. Amen.</p>
                <p><strong>Evening Examen</strong><br>Tonight, as the light fades, I pause to look back on my day. Where did I glimpse the sacred in the ordinary—in a conversation, a meal, a moment outdoors? Where did I miss it? Thank You, gentle God, for hiding in plain sight; help me notice You more tomorrow.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="prompt">
                <h2>Interactive Journal Prompt</h2>
                <p>In your busy modern life, where do you most easily sense something sacred or larger than yourself—in nature, in daily routines like cooking or commuting, or in moments of quiet? How might treating those ordinary moments as thin places where heaven touches earth change the way you move through your day?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="vet">
                <h2>The 'Vet' Check</h2>
                <p>This emphasis on a sacramental, holistic worldview—where creation is infused with divine presence and nature serves as God’s “second book”—is a core characteristic repeatedly highlighted in studies of early Christian spirituality in the Celtic lands. It reflects an authentic historical thread of deep reverence for the created world, distinguishing these local expressions of faith while remaining firmly rooted in broader Christian tradition, making it spiritually significant as an invitation to experience God’s immanence in everyday life.</p>

        <div class="day">
            <p><em>Days 2–40 follow a similar structure, exploring the full breadth of Celtic spirituality: saints' lives, spiritual practices, historical concepts, and the tension between historical reality and modern aspiration.
