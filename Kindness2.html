"Squeak is everyone's hero out here. A trail angel who is so in love with the culture she just let's anyone and everyone sleep in the yard for free. There are three rules: you can't defecate in the yard, you can't let the cats out, and you can't do meth, crack, or heroin with the neighbors. Otherwise, she says, make yourself at home.

2fer was here when I got here and soon Weatherman and Colideskope joined in, all sleeping in the yard. Squeak plays bagpipes professionally, and plays in a band every Thursday. She let me blow into them and I gained a new respect for every piper on Earth. I had no idea just how hard it is to sound the Goose, I could get all three drones but that was it. Squeak serenaded the neighborhood with a few songs then put her pipes away.

We spent the night talking about hikers, dead people, strippers, tinder, music and Scotland, then finished with a shot of Irish whiskey and I went off to bed. https://www.trailjournals.com/journal/entry/640676
