            <p>Exile for Love – Embracing voluntary wandering in service to God, as modeled by Columbanus.</p>

            <div class="snippet">
                <h2>The Snippet</h2>
                <p>Saint Columbanus (c. 540–615 AD) is celebrated as the greatest of the peregrini, undertaking lifelong voluntary exile to establish monasteries across Europe, including Luxeuil in France and Bobbio in Italy. He left behind a strict monastic Rule and Penitentials that influenced continental monasticism. His bold commitment exemplifies peregrinatio pro amore Dei—exile for the love of God—as radical trust in divine guidance.</p>

                <p>Columbanus represents the pinnacle of peregrinatio, with his European foundations and writings marking significant historical impact on monasticism beyond Celtic lands. His life highlights the ascetic depth and missionary zeal central to early Celtic spiritual practice.</p>

                <h2>The Snippet</h2>
                <p>Peregrinatio pro amore Dei was an ascetic discipline where monks or nuns permanently left home, family, and possessions to wander into the unknown, entrusting themselves entirely to God's direction. This 'exile for the love of God' embodied radical faith and openness to divine leading. It shaped the missionary outreach of many Celtic saints across Europe.</p>

            <div class="snippet">
                <h2>The Snippet</h2>
                <p>Celtic spirituality classified spiritual dedication into threefold martyrdom: Red (physical death for Christ), White (abandoning all loved things, often through exile), and Green/Blue (rigorous penance, fasting, and labor to conquer inner desires). This framework offered varied paths to heroic faithfulness. It reflected a nuanced understanding of sacrifice accessible beyond literal martyrdom.</p>

                <h2>The Snippet</h2>
                <p>Anam cara, meaning 'soul friend,' was a profound relational practice involving a trusted spiritual companion who offered guidance and deepened one's relationship with God. This bond often transcended social norms, providing honest mirroring and support. It embodied the Celtic value of community in spiritual growth.</p>
