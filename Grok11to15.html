                <p>The caim is a traditional encompassing prayer used to draw a spiritual circle of protection around oneself, loved ones, or community. Rooted in the imagery of circling with the finger or hand, it invokes God's presence as a shield.

Famous examples include St. Patrick's Breastplate, binding the pray-er to God's power. These rhythmic invocations highlight Celtic confidence in divine safeguarding amid a perilous world.</p>
